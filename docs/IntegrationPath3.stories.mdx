# 3. Adding New Component

## Preconditions:

Component is “Recommended” or you are first integrator and status is “Ready for First Integration”
SPA has not integrated hey-uikit yet

## Steps

- Before starting an implementation you should follow the following steps and checks:
  - First check if the component you are looking for is in the **[OTP Global Design Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/rrvkvQEoVTOHa7MzyKSaoz/OTP-Global-Design-System?node-id=715%3A110433)**
    - Any component that is not in the figma or not in green status should not be implemented to GDS
    - For these cases ping #global-design-system channel . Then your required components will be communicated with Design Team
  - Any component implementation related process needs to be tracked on **[HEYUI Jira project](https://www.figma.com/file/rrvkvQEoVTOHa7MzyKSaoz/OTP-Global-Design-System?node-id=715%3A110433)** so that the relevant parties can see the process on implementations
    - Create a component Epic if there is none for the component in question. And link this to your own project if need be. Use Checkbox Component Epic as an example
  - Start your implementation which will end in the Component becoming in `Ready for First Integration` status on storybook
    - Follow the **[General Contribution guidelines](https://hey-car.github.io/heycar-uikit/main/?path=/docs/guidelines-contributing--page)** while doing your implementation
  - Create your PR and get it reviewed
    - open the PR review
    - put your implementation task to code review on the jira board
  - When your implementation is got an OK on the PR review , ask for a design review
    - From your end this is mainly putting the implementation task in the design review state on jira.
