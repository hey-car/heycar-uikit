# 2. Almost Happy Path

## Preconditions:

Component is “Recommended” or you are first integrator and status is “Ready for First Integration”
SPA has not integrated hey-uikit yet

## Steps

- which means you need to do installation step as documented
- use it where you need it
- and then check your build and deploy step to see if the imported components work
- Again on any integrations problems contact:
  - **#global-design-system-integration-help** : for general integration questions
  - **#global-design-system** : for design related questions
