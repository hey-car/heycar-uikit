        <p>
          You’ll struggle to find any objective reasons to buy a Q3 Sportback
          over the standard Audi Q3. But, if you want to stand out, the
          Sportback is rarer than the regular car and barely any more expensive
          on the used market. It’s cheap to run - and it’s more practical than
          you might expect.
        </p>
        Combine that with low running costs and a strong engine line-up (including
        the 1.5 mild-hybrid petrol), and the Q3 Sportback gets easier to justify.

      <Accordion title="What’s the best Audi Q3 Sportback model/engine to choose">
        <p>
          We reckon the most affordable engine in the Q3 Sportback is actually
          the one to go for. The 1.5 TFSI is quick enough for most drivers,
          cheap to run and available with a manual or S tronic automatic
          transmission. An automatic gearbox is desirable in a car like this but
          it can be a bit hesitant, so don’t dismiss the manual.
        </p>
        In terms of trim levels, the Q3 Sportback will look sharper and get more
        equipment if you opt for one of the pricier models, but the standard Sport
        model has pretty much everything you could possibly wish for. In typical
        Audi form, the Q3 Sportback is at its most comfortable on the smallest wheels
        - the 18-inch alloys fitted to Sport models.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="What other cars are similar to the Audi Q3 Sportback?">
        <p>
          The BMW X2 is the Q3 Sportback’s main rival - based on the X1 with
          sleeker looks and a less practical cabin. We’d be very tempted by the
          Volvo XC40, which is a trendy small SUV with a brilliant interior,
          while the latest Range Rover Evoque is another solid alternative
          (although don’t be tempted by the old model, replaced in 2019).{' '}
        </p>
        If practicality’s what you want, look at the standard Audi Q3 instead, or
        the very similar (but less premium) Volkswagen Tiguan. Then there are left-field
        alternatives like the Lexus NX and even the bigger DS 7 Crossback.
